abstract: >-
  AI-Augmented Dialectics Theory (AADT) represents a paradigmatic shift in how humans 
  engage with artificial intelligenceâ€”not as cognitive outsourcing, but as cognitive 
  evolution. This framework integrates Eastern dialectical philosophy with cutting-edge 
  AI capabilities to restore human epistemic sovereignty while leveraging artificial 
  intelligence for enhanced thinking. AADT moves beyond conventional prompt engineering 
  to establish a comprehensive framework for human-AI co-thinking that preserves and 
  enhances human agency, creativity, and wisdom.
