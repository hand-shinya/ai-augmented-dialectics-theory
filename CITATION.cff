title: "AI-Augmented Dialectics Theory: Epistemological Revolution in Human-AI Co-Evolution"
version: "1.0.0"
abstract: "AI-Augmented Dialectics Theory (AADT) represents a paradigmatic shift in how humans engage with artificial intelligenceâ€”not as cognitive outsourcing, but as cognitive evolution. This framework integrates Eastern dialectical philosophy with cutting-edge AI capabilities to restore human epistemic sovereignty while leveraging artificial intelligence for enhanced thinking. AADT moves beyond conventional prompt engineering to establish a comprehensive framework for human-AI co-thinking that preserves and enhances human agency, creativity, and wisdom."
